# Portfolio website refactor

This repo is about the refactor of [my portfolio website](www.matthieudesvignes.com). It's a static website with an admin part : everything is customizable. The admin part is build on Symfony, API Platform and React Admin for a REST api managing data. The front part is made with React.JS.

## Local installation

I host my website on a mutualized server so what you need is :

- PHP 7.4
- MySQL 5.7
- Apache

Also, in order to build dependencies, you will need :

- Composer (Symfony dependencies)

**Installation**

    // from /api
